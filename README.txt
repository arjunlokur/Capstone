Guide to the different Notebooks:

1 - Capstone:
This is the notebook kicking off the project. It has all the data cleaning, EDA and feature engineering.

2 - Awards Data:
This is supplementary data on the Oscar and Emmy awards that I thought might be useful, which I decided to add in later.

3 - IMDB Votes Modeling:
Our first modelling notebook, where I try different models for the regression problem IMDB votes

4 - IMDB Score Modeling:
Our second modelling notebook, where I try different models for the classification problem IMDB Score

5 - Neural Networks with Word Embeddings:
An alternate approach to modelling and feature engineering, using word embeddings on the 2 text columns (Description and Titles) and then trying neural networks.


Special Libraries used - none beyond what we've used in the lectures.

Data - all the data is in the folder. Only the Lexvec word embedding model for the Neural networks notebook isn't, as it's a 1.05 GB file. However this is the same file as we used for the class notebook.
